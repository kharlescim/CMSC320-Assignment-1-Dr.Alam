Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: It allows a streamlined way to manage all changes to files and 
collaboration among users. Since it stores the history of all changes to 
any files, any mistakes or issues can easily be fixed by switching to a 
previous version. In addition, it allows for collaborators to have all of 
their work in a single place, while still allowing them to clone their own
workspace for their own usage or innovations. Finally, it allows for 
projects of massive sizes to be stored easily online, while smaller 
portions can still be edited and tested on your local machine.
